Description:
		Exposes SEV confidential computing (coco) secrets to
		userspace via securityfs.

		AMD SEV and SEV-ES allow the Guest Owner to inject secrets
		during VM's launch.  The secrets are encrypted by the Guest
		Owner and decrypted by the AMD-SP (secure processor), and
		therefore are not readable by the untrusted host.

		The sev_secret module exposes the secrets to userspace.  Each
		secret appears as a file under <securityfs>/coco/sev_secret,
		where the filename is the GUID of the entry in the secrets
		table.

		Two operations are supported for the files: read and unlink.
		Reading the file returns the content of secret entry.
		Unlinking the file overwrites the secret data with zeroes and
		removes the entry from the filesystem.  A secret cannot be read
		after it has been unlinked.

		For example, listing the available secrets::

		  # modprobe sev_secret
		  # ls -l /sys/kernel/security/coco/sev_secret
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 736870e5-84f0-4973-92ec-06879ce3da0b
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 83c83f7f-1356-4975-8b7e-d3a0b54312c6
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 9553f55d-3da2-43ee-ab5d-ff17f78864d2
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 e6f5a162-d67f-4750-a67c-5d065f2a9910

		Reading the secret data by reading a file::

		  # cat /sys/kernel/security/coco/sev_secret/e6f5a162-d67f-4750-a67c-5d065f2a9910
		  the-content-of-the-secret-data

		Wiping a secret by unlinking a file::

		  # rm /sys/kernel/security/coco/sev_secret/e6f5a162-d67f-4750-a67c-5d065f2a9910
		  # ls -l /sys/kernel/security/coco/sev_secret
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 736870e5-84f0-4973-92ec-06879ce3da0b
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 83c83f7f-1356-4975-8b7e-d3a0b54312c6
		  -r--r----- 1 root root 0 Jun 28 11:54 9553f55d-3da2-43ee-ab5d-ff17f78864d2

		Note: The binary format of the secrets table injected by the
		Guest Owner is described in
		drivers/virt/coco/sev_secret/sev_secret.c under "Structure of
		the SEV secret area".
